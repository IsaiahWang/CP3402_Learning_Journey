# Week 3 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I created a platform webiste for my startup business using a downloaded template that employs HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework. Meanwhile, I customized the template extensively to suit the business objectives. My platform mainly assits students who are struggling in their assignments and courseworks by providing help from their peers. Besides the programming part, I identified specific features and funtionalities to be included in my plarform to make the website actually functional. And I analyzed a few competitors in the market to identify strengths and weaknesses.
## Estimated Hours
I spent around 5 hours on the webiste designing and implementing and I spend another 3 hours on conducting research on peer tutoring and analysing competitors in the market.
## Content Insights
Firstly, by combining the business planning and website programming, I gained more knowledge between practical webiste development and research for business understanding. Secondly, I gained more confidence in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap through practical application. Thirdly, I found that websites may render differently on varous devices. Testing my website across multiple devices to ensure consistent performance is essential for readability.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
After completing this practical, fristly I understood the practical application of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in real-world projects. A good learning approach is to examine others' mature and professional projects and identifying common coding practices because common practices often emphasize efficient coding styles and preferences. And by learning from those common practices, I can have a broader understanding of those techniques. In addition, I realised that successful design starts by understanding the users and their needs. Designs should effectively communicate information and guide users through tasks. So the lession I learned is in the future when I design websites, the website must have clear visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation to effectively guide users through tasks.
