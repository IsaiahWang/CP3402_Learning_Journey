# Week 3 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week's focus was on creating a simple WordPress site for my startup, a transition from last week's Joomla task. The process involved setting up a WordPress environment, either locally or hosted online. I leveraged the content and design from my Joomla site, focusing more on mastering WordPress as a CMS (Content Management System). Additionally, I participated in a unique group formation task, which resembled a "job interview style" exercise. This involved interacting with my peers, conducting one-minute interviews, and noting attributes that could contribute to a successful group project.

## Estimated Hours
The WordPress site development took approximately 8 hours, considering I reused most of the content and design from the Joomla site. The group formation exercise, including preparation, interviews, and note-taking, took around 3 hours.
## Content Insights
Transitioning to WordPress highlighted the differences and similarities between various CMS platforms. WordPress's user-friendly interface and extensive documentation made the transition smoother. The group formation exercise was insightful in understanding team dynamics. It taught me the importance of assessing soft skills like communication, reliability, and teamwork in a potential team member. This experience also highlighted the value of clear and concise communication, especially in time-constrained scenarios like the one-minute interviews.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
The exercise in WordPress has improved my adaptability skills in learning and using different CMS platforms, an essential skill in the dynamic field of web development. The group formation task provided a practical understanding of the nuances of team-building and the significance of interpersonal skills in a professional setting. It emphasized the importance of choosing team members not just based on technical skills but also on their ability to collaborate and communicate effectively. This experience has enhanced my appreciation for diverse skill sets in a team and the need for effective communication in professional environments. Overall, these activities have contributed to my development as a more versatile and team-oriented professional.
