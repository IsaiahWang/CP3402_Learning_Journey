## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 4.5 hours this week on working with child themes in WordPress:
- 2 hours - Researching and reading up on child theme practice
- 2 hours - Creating child theme, implementing changes
- 0.5 hours - Testing customizations, troubleshooting issues
## Content Insights
The ability to work with WordPress and child themes is very useful for web developers. The key takeaway is that child themes allow developers to modify style and functionality of an existing parent theme without altering the original parent files. This ensures customizations remain intact when the parent theme receives updates. From a technical perspective, I now understand that the functions.php file handles functionality changes like registering menus or widgets, while the style.css file controls visual customizations. Overriding the parent theme's CSS styles requires properly structuring selector specificity. Additionally, troubleshooting child theme issues demands methodical analysis when themes don't display correctly. The entire process showed the inner workings of how themes inherit from one another. Moving forward, I feel equipped to build custom child themes to meet client needs. I also gained practical experience in inspecting and overriding CSS, which will prove valuable in eventually developing my own parent themes from scratch.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
This week's hands-on experience creating a WordPress child theme provided valuable professional development in web design and development. On a practical level, I gained critical technical skills in customizing themes. Learning how child themes inherit functionality while allowing style and template overrides was an essential insight that deepened my grasp of theme hierarchy. The systematic process of troubleshooting child theme implementation issues also sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Beyond specific competencies, exercising my ability to research, follow tutorials, and self-direct my learning on this project  are vital in the fast-paced technology industry. Being resourceful and teaching oneself new concepts quickly is important for delivering client solutions, and this week's activities provided realistic training. Overall, the child theme project expanded both my web development toolkit and my capacity to continue acquiring new technical and soft skills essential for career advancement.
