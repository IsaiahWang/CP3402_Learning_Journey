# Week 4 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week's objective was to demonstrate a dynamic website with a database, either through a CMS or directly using code and a database, running on my localhost. However, since my WordPress site is hosted on AWS Lightsail, I decided to take a slightly different approach. I created a database in Lightsail, following the instructions from Amazon Lightsail's documentation on creating a database. This task involved setting up the database, configuring it to work with WordPress, and ensuring secure and efficient data handling. Alongside this, I brushed up on my SQL skills to manage and query the database effectively.

## Estimated Hours
The entire process, including setting up the database in Lightsail, integrating it with my WordPress site, and testing the functionality, took around 10 hours. Additional time was spent on learning and revising SQL concepts, which accounted for approximately 2 hours.
## Content Insights
Working on integrating a database with my WordPress site on AWS Lightsail provided practical insights into the complexities of managing dynamic websites. It highlighted the importance of database management in web development, especially for sites requiring frequent content updates and user interactions. I learned about various aspects of database setup, such as choosing the right database type, understanding security configurations, and optimizing performance for better user experience. Moreover, refreshing my SQL skills was crucial in managing the database more effectively.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
This week's task was instrumental in enhancing my technical skills, particularly in database management and integration with web applications. It underscored the significance of back-end technologies in building robust and dynamic websites. The experience also honed my problem-solving skills, as I navigated through various challenges in setting up and configuring the database. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies in the ever-evolving field of web development. This activity has furthered my competence in managing full-stack development projects, making me a more versatile and skilled professional in the technology sector.
