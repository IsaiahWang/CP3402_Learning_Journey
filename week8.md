# Week 8 Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week's objective was to conduct a learning experiment using the scientific method to enhance my learning efficiency. My theory was that active recall and spaced repetition, when combined, would significantly improve my retention and understanding of new concepts in web development compared to my usual study methods. Active recall involves testing oneself on the material to be learned, while spaced repetition involves reviewing the material at increasing intervals over time.

To test this theory, I split my learning content into two equal parts. For the first part, I used my usual study method of reading and note-taking. For the second part, I implemented active recall by creating flashcards of key concepts and employed spaced repetition by reviewing these flashcards after 1 hour, 1 day, and 1 week. I then assessed my understanding and retention of both parts through a self-designed quiz.

## Estimated Hours
The setup and execution of my learning experiment took around 3 hours. This included the time spent in dividing the study materials, creating flashcards, scheduling review sessions, and designing the quiz for assessment.

## Content Insights
The learning experiment provided valuable insights into effective study techniques. Preliminary results from the quiz showed a noticeable improvement in my retention and understanding of the material studied with active recall and spaced repetition. This suggests that these techniques are powerful tools for enhancing learning efficiency, especially in complex fields such as web development. The experiment also underscored the importance of being proactive and innovative in one's learning approach, adapting and experimenting with different methods to find what works best.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights 
Engaging in a learning experiment using the scientific method is a practical exercise in critical thinking and problem-solving, skills highly valued in the web development field. This experience has not only improved my learning efficiency but has also prepared me to tackle complex problems with a systematic approach. The ability to learn and adapt quickly is crucial in the fast-paced tech industry, and this week's activities have enhanced these competencies, positioning me for future success in my career. My proactive approach to learning and experimentation will also be an asset in team settings, contributing to more innovative and effective project outcomes.
